            <h2 class="what-is">What are we doing?</h2>

            <p class="whatis-text">To help us make the decidOR website a positive place for everyone, we've been using the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1</a>. These guidelines explain how to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities, and user friendly for everyone.</p>

            <p class="whatis-text">The guidelines have three levels of accessibility (A, AA and AAA). We’ve chosen Level AA as the target for the decidOR website.</p>

            <h2 class="what-is">How are we doing?</h2>
